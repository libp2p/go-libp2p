# test-plans test implementation (go-libp2p)

This folder contains go-libp2p’s transport interop “ping” test app and Dockerfile used by the `libp2p/test-plans` transport suite.

## Canonical docs

See the upstream transport harness documentation:

- `https://github.com/libp2p/test-plans/blob/master/transport/README.md`

## Outdated docs

Historical notes that referenced the old `transport-interop/` + `npm`-based runner are kept in:

- `README.OUTDATED.md`
